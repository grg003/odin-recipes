<p>The ingredients<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon garlic powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Let's get started</p>
<p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
